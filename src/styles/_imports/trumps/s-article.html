            <p class="drop-cap">The complexity of the human brain is astounding. With more onnections between neurons than stars in the Milky Way, the organ that gives rise to vision, language, nd thought is a remarkable product of evolution.</p>
            <p>Once, the only way to understand the functioning of the brain was hrough thought itself. With modern medicine came more thorough anatomical investigations of the parts f the brain. Microscopy brought an awareness of neurons; EEGs helped identify complex signaling atterns among neurons; MRIs mapped the localization of thought. And newer technologies like positron mission tomography, transmission electron microscopy, and optoelectronics, have all added insights into ow the brain is structured and operates.</p>

            <p>But an important new tool entered neuroscience in the 1970’s and rguably changed the field more than any that had preceded it: the computer.</p>
            <p>Advanced computing enables researchers to create detailed 3D models of rain structures, map regions of the brain, and understand the delicate interplay of cells, electricity, nd chemicals that enables the brain to understand the Universe and create great works of art.</p>
            <p>As computers have grown more powerful over the decades, euroscientists have applied new techniques to push the boundaries of what can be studied.</p>
            <p>Artificial intelligence, in the form of machine learning and deep earning, is the latest such technique to impact the field. AI is advancing computers’ ability to econstruct images, analyze data, and find meaning in complex patterns of activity, prompting new heories of the mind.</p>
            <p>TACC, a leader in advanced computing with some of the largest systems vailable to researchers in the world, is helping neuroscientists use AI to diagnose diseases, elucidate he function of neurons, and derive fundamental knowledge about the organ.</p>
            <p>“The combination of high performance computing, AI, and brain data are owering a revolution in the field,” said Matt Vaughn, TACC’s Director of Life Sciences. “It’s a new rontier of knowledge.”</p>

            <h3>AI Feeds on Data</h3>
            <p>Machine learning and deep learning rely on the availability of massive mounts of data to derive models of brain function or ask questions of these models. Scientists can requently be protective of their data — the basis for discoveries — but since 2009, Stanford University euroscientist Russell Poldrack has led an effort to encourage the sharing and pooling of brain data, pecifically task-based fMRI data, for the betterment of science.</p>
            <h4>Test Header Four</h4>
            <h5>Test Header Four</h5>
            <p>Originally known as <a href="https://openfmri.org/" target="_blank">OpenfMRI</a>, the project, with upport from TACC and funding from NSF, developed a eb-accessible database of more than 500 datasets.</p>
            <p>“In recent years, there has been a movement towards the sharing of arge, well-curated, and highly general datasets such as the Human Connectome Project,” Poldrack and his ollaborator Krzysztof J. Gorgolewski wrote in <a ref="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4669234/" target="_blank">NeuroImage</a>. “The oal of OpenfMRI is to provide a complementary venue for every fMRI researcher to publish their task MRI data, regardless of the size or generality of the dataset.”</p>
            <p>Training AI systems was not necessarily Poldrack’s goal when OpenfMRI aunched, but the availability of multiple, large datasets has subsequently allowed researchers, ncluding Poldrack, to begin applying machine and deep learning techniques to their studies.</p>
            <p>A <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8627955" target="_blank">team of Japanese researchers</a>
                recently used OpenfMRI data to develop a deep eural generative model for diagnosing psychiatric disorders; another team used images from OpenfMRI and eep learning methods to develop an MRI quality control tool for automatically extracting quality easures from new MRI images.</p>
            <p>Recently, the project added other modalities of data besides fMRI and as recast as <a href="https://openneuro.org/" target="_blank">OpenNeuro</a>. Beyond hosting the atabase, TACC allows researchers to apply machine learning in ways that are not possible elsewhere.</p>
            <p>Poldrack’s recent study, published in <em>Nature Communications</em>, sed machine learning to explore self-regulation and predict an individual's risk for alcoholism, besity, and drug abuse based on surveys and task-based studies. They found that by applying more igorous statistical methods they could uncover underlying structures of the mind, a process they call data-driven ontology discovery.'</p>
            <p>"We're bringing to bear serious machine learning methods to determine hat's being correlated, and what has generalizable predictive accuracy, using methods that are still airly new to this area of research," Poldrack said.</p>
            <p>Poldrack’s team is also using neural networks for practical analytical asks like reconstructing an image from coarse descriptions in journal papers, and removing the facial tructure from the image so it is not identifiable. For these, and the more sophisticated deep learning tudies he anticipates, advanced computing is critical.</p>
            <p>“If you want to build a model of the visual system, there are lots of ossible architectures and the only way to know which one is right is to search across all of them,” he aid. “You can run one model on a desktop, but for running 10,000s of those models and doing model omparison across them, high performance computing is necessary.”</p>
            <h3>Applying AI to diseases of the brain</h3>
            <p>Two researchers using TACC systems and AI to plan brain treatments and iagnose disorders are George Biros and David Schnyer, professors of mechanical engineering and sychology at UT Austin.</p>
            <p>Biros, a computational expert and two-time winner of the Gordon Bell rize (a major distinction in the supercomputing world), <a ref="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/-/scientists-enlist-supercomputers-machine-learning-to-automatically-identify-brain-tumors" arget="_blank">developed an algorithm</a> that combines mathematical models of tumor growth with achine learning to identify brain tumors in preoperative MR scans with an accuracy that matches that of trained radiologist.</p>

            <p>"Our goal is to take an image and delineate it automatically and dentify different types of abnormal tissue,” Biros said. “It's similar to taking a picture of one's amily and doing facial recognition to identify each member, but here you do tissue recognition."</p>
            <p>Using TACC’s Frontera, the largest supercomputer at any university in he world, Biros is adding many more factors to his machine learning model than was previously possible, nd training the systems to detect the extent of cancers beyond the main tumor growth — which is ifficult to determine by imaging alone — and to track a tumor to its origin, which can assist in etermining the best treatment.</p>
            <p>The tissue classifier is being used in clinical trials at the niversity of Pennsylvania in partnership with his collaborator, Christos Davatzikos, director of the enter for Biomedical Image Computing and Analytics. Predictive simulations guide surgeons to a re-specified location in the patient’s brain to take tissue from so it can be compared with the models o determine its accuracy.</p>

            <p>AI-enabled tumor recognition won't replace radiologists and surgeons ny time soon, Biros says, but it will improve the quality of assessments and potentially speed up iagnosis.</p>
            <p>Psychologist David Schnyer has been <a ref="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/-/psychologists-enlist-machine-learning-to-help-diagnose-depression" arget="_blank">using similar methods</a> to study aspects of brain function that may signal ulnerability to depression.</p>
            <p>His team used machine learning on Stampede2 at TACC to classify ndividuals with major depressive disorder.</p>
            <p>Schnyer and his team labeled features in their brain imaging data that ere thought to be meaningful, and marked them as belonging to either healthy individuals or those who ave been diagnosed with depression. He used these examples to train the system, and TACC’s upercomputers cycled through the data, fine-tuning a model that could identify subtle connections etween disparate parts of the brain. Once trained, the model assigned new subjects to one category or he other. They found it could predict risk for depression with roughly 75 percent accuracy.</p>
            <p>“Not only are we learning that we can classify depressed versus on-depressed people using DTI [Diffusion Tensor Imaging], we’re also learning something about how epression is represented within the brain,” said Christopher Beevers, director of the Institute for ental Health Research at UT Austin and Schnyer’s collaborator. “Rather than trying to find the area hat is disrupted in depression, we’re learning that alterations across a number of networks contribute o the classification of depression,” Beevers said.</p>
            <p>Schnyer is currently using machine learning to analyze the results of three-year, National Institutes of Health-funded study to determine the effectiveness of cognitive herapies for depression. Schnyer uses TACC systems for similar efforts to diagnose age-related ognitive decline and traumatic brain injuries.</p>
            <p>“Artificial intelligence has the potential to help us uncover and iagnose diseases much earlier and in ways that were impossible before,” Schnyer said.</p>
            <p>Researchers, however, are divided on this application. Poldrack says e is leery of saying deep learning will be useful for diagnosis, per se, but believes AI will help haracterize mental health disorders and understand their structure.</p>
            <p>“There’s been a lot of debate about the whole way that we talk about isorders,” he said. “Breaking them into diagnostic categories like schizophrenia or depression is not iologically realistic because both genetics and neuroscience show that those disorders have way more verlap than difference. I think that deep learning will help derive new paradigms to understand isorders of the brain.”</p>
            <h3>Speeding up an 8 trillion year project</h3>
            <p>For Kristen Harris, a neuroscientist at UT Austin who has spent years tudying and modeling a section of the brain smaller than a red blood cell, her efforts to map the brain equired her and her team to identify and hand-color structures of the brain in images of brain slices. hese were then combined by supercomputers into 3D models that elucidated how the various parts of eurons fit together and enable brain functions.</p>
            <p>“Using current methods, it would take eight trillion years of human abor to fully map the connections in the brain,” Harris explained.</p>
            <p>AI has the potential to help speed up feature identification, tructural analysis, and 3D reconstructions of the brain.</p>
            <p>“In a billionth of the time that it took me to identify 10 examples of cell structure in an image, the computer can show me 200 of them,” Harris said. “Every single thing hat we discover and can define well, we can delegate to an artificial intelligence system to repeat at cale.”</p>
            <p>There’s another way AI can speed up brain imaging: by enabling faster mage capture. Recently, Uri Manor, director of the Waitt Advanced Biophotonics Core Facility at the alk Institute for Biological Studies in San Diego, used TACC resources to train a neural network that an transform low resolution images (which can be captured quickly) into higher resolution ones.</p>
            <p>By using pairs of high-resolution and noisy low-resolution versions of icroscopy images, they were able to recreate super-resolution images from ones captured at lower esolution. This has the upside of allowing far faster imaging (which in turn allows more coverage of rain areas) and enabling thousands of labs without state-of-the-art equipment to produce images that an resolve small-scale structures in the brain.</p>
            <p>“To image the entire brain at full resolution could take over a undred years,” Manor explained. “But with a 16 times increase in throughput, it perhaps becomes 10 ears, which is much more practical.”</p>
            <h3>What am I thinking now?</h3>
            <p>A third area of neuroscience research where AI is having an impact is nderstanding how activities like language processing, vision, and memory formation occur.</p>
            <p><a href="https://www.tacc.utexas.edu/-/brain-inspired-ai-inspires-insights-about-the-brain-and-vice-versa-" arget="_blank">Alex Huth</a>, a computer scientist and member of the Center for Theoretical and omputational Neuroscience at UT Austin, uses deep learning and fMRI scanning to localize language oncepts and predict, with greater accuracy than ever before, how different areas in the brain respond o specific words.</p>
            <p>"As words come into our heads, we form ideas of what someone is saying o us, and we want to understand how that happens," said Huth. "Like anything in biology, it's very hard o reduce down to a simple set of equations."</p>
            <p>Huth’s work employs a type of recurrent neural network called ‘long hort-term memory’ that includes in its calculations the relationships of each word to what came before o better preserve context. The team relied on powerful supercomputers at TACC to train the neural etwork and run a series of computationally-intensive experiments.</p>
            <p>These experiments uncovered which parts of the brain were more ensitive to the amount of context included. "There was a really nice correspondence between the ierarchy of the artificial network and the hierarchy of the brain, which we found interesting," Huth aid.</p>
            <p>This application of AI to brain scans might one day translate into mind-reading” capabilities. “If the technology can be sufficiently miniaturized, we could imagine ventually replacing interfaces that require users to type on a keyboard or speak (like Siri) with irect brain communication,” said Huth.</p>
            <h3>Caveats and Opportunities</h3>
            <p>Though the hype surrounding AI can make the prospect of machines that earn and reason seem inevitable or terrifying, many neuroscientists see limits to the ways today’s achine and deep learning methods can advance neuroscience.</p>
            <p>Some, like Thomas Yankeelov, a computational oncologist at UT’s Dell edical School, fear the field has fallen into a trap with its commitment to ‘Big Data’ and ‘machine earning’ to attack cancer.</p>
            <p>“The belief is that if we collect enough data on enough patients, then e will be able to find statistical patterns indicating the best way to treat patients and find cures. his is fundamentally misguided,” Yankeelov recently wrote in an op-ed in The Hill. “Machine learning elies on properties of large groups of people that hide characteristics of the individual patient — his is especially problematic for a disease that manifests itself so differently from person to erson.”</p>
            <p>Harris, on the other hand, sees benefits from AI systems, such as xtrapolating human-labeled data to large corpuses that would take hundreds of smart graduate students enturies to sift through, but sees limits to their usefulness as well.</p>
            <p>“There's no such thing as AI without I. A human being needs to look at he data from the beginning,” Harris said. “Neuroscience is not just about counting how many synapses re in the brain and determining how they are connected. An AI system won’t ever be able to understand nything new about brain functioning, and there’s still cell biology that needs to be discovered.”</p>
            <p>According to Schnyer, the early misuse of machine learning methods led o many poor studies and false conclusions. But the field, as a whole, has learned from its mistakes and oved beyond the simplistic use of machine learning and onto more rigorous studies.</p>
            <p>“We’ve learned that we need larger datasets and more sophisticated tatistical methods to come to robust conclusions,” Schnyer said. “We also need to strive for greater eproducibility and transparency in the application of machine learning methods.”</p>
            <p>This lesson comes with a cost… the need for powerful computers capable f comparing far larger numbers of samples and running many more repetitions to arrive at a solution. Moreover, in applications like disease diagnosis or treatment planning, the threshold for a trustworthy nswer will be high, and resolving issues like the explainability of a deep learning system will be entral to building trust.</p>
            <p>But the benefits of applying advanced computing and AI to neuroscience re potentially massive. From identifying and slowing cognitive decline, to augmenting human ntelligence, to better understanding what it means to love or gain wisdom, the brain is an arena where I research may offer the greatest rewards.</p>
