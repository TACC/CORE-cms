# Static Articles

## Intention

Support static addition of news articles that originate from a Core news site.

A [dynamic solution that pulls form the Core news site](https://github.com/TACC/Core-CMS/issues/69) is preferable.

But this is not available due to constrainst of architecture, time, or ability.
