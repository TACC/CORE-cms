# TACC CMS - Stylesheets

Stylesheets are built from source code entry point files located in `./exports*`. Styles are imported from source code files located in `./_imports/*`.

Add new stylesheets into these locations to be picked up by the `npm run build` task and the django `collectstatic` steps.

See [project `README.md` at "Building Static Resources"](/README.md#Building%20Static%20Resources).
