# TACC CMS - Fonts

This directory is a shared asset, but it is not in `site_shared`, because the path to load it `../../fonts/` is in a shared file which __must not__ be edited.

See [`Cortal-Icons-1.2.md`](./Cortal-Icons-1.2.md).

## To Do

- [ ] Move this directory to `../site_shared` when paths can be configured on CMS and Portal (maybe via alias-based paths)
