# TACC CMS - Shared Static Files

SYNC SOURCE FILES HERE WITH CMS & PORTAL & DOCS!

The directory structure __must__ mirror that of [`../site_cms`](`../site_cms`).

## To Do

- [ ] Create a GitHUb repo that shares source files between Portal, CMS, and User Guide.

## Documentation Format

```
/* WARNING: This file is copied from Portal repo */
/* TODO: Share source code between CMS, Portal, & User Guide */
/* SEE: https://github.com/TACC/Frontera-Portal/blob/master/… */

/* … */
```
