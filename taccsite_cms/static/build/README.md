# TACC CMS - Minified & Processed Files

DO NOT ADD SOURCE CODE HERE!

These files are the minified and processed output from the `npm run build` step.

See [project `README.md` at "Building Static Resources"](/README.md#Building%20Static%20Resources).

All stylesheets are built

- __from__ `../site_cms/__FILE_TYPE__/exports/*` source code entry point files, and populated
- __to__ `../build/__FILE_TYPE__/*` as matching build artifacts.

Add new stylesheets into that directory, __NEVER__ this directory!
These will __not__ be tracked in the repository and therefore unavailable to the portal.
